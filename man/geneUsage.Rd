\arguments{
\item{.data}{The data to be processed. Can be \link{data.frame},
\link{data.table}, or a list of these objects.

Every object must have columns in the immunarch compatible format.
\link{immunarch_data_format}

Competent users may provide advanced data representations:
DBI database connections, Apache Spark DataFrame from \link{copy_to} or a list
of these objects. They are supported with the same limitations as basic objects.

Note: each connection must represent a separate repertoire.}

\item{.gene}{A character vector of length one with the name of the gene you want
to analyse of the specific species. If you provide a vector of different length, only first element
will be used. The string should also contain the species of interest, for example, valid ".gene" arguments
are "hs.trbv", "HomoSapiens.TRBJ" or "macmul.IGHV". For details run \code{gene_stats()}.}

\item{.quant}{Select the column with data to evaluate.
Pass NA if you want to compute gene statistics at the clonotype level without re-weighting.
Pass "count" to use the "Clones" column to weight genes by abundance of their corresponding clonotypes.}

\item{.ambig}{An option to handle ambiguous data. You can exclude data for the cases where
there is no clear match for gene, include it for every supplied gene, include it with weights,
or pick only first from the set. Set it to "exc", "inc", "wei", or "maj", correspondingly.}

\item{.type}{Set the type of data to evaluate: "segment", "allele", or "family".}

\item{.norm}{If TRUE than return proportions of genes. If FALSE then return counts of genes.}

\description{
An utility function to analyse the immune receptor gene usage
(IGHD, IGHJ, IDHV, IGIJ, IGKJ, IGKV, IGLJ, IGLV, TRAJ, TRAV, TRBD, etc.)
and statistics. For gene details run \code{gene_stats()}.
